Hello! I am Yikai Si.

I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Physics at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interests lie in computational neuroscience and machine learning.

I am passionate about using computational methods to understand the brain's complex dynamics and developing biologically plausible machine learning algorithms.
